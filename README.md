# useful_scripts
A list of useful scripts I have used to automate my workflow


screen.sh is a script that moves your display and changes your resolution, This is useful if your laptop screen has a certain area not working or artefacted. and usually these artefacts occour vertically. Just change the new_x and new_y and the formula to move your screen logically

gitpusher.sh is a quick script that adds all files, commits all of them with a user input message and pushes them to the upstream branch
I personally like, the following actions on a commit
* start
* stop
* fix
* change
* add
* edit
* bug

quickc.sh and safec.sh are scripts that compile c programs with certain common flags. quick compiles without sanitizers, safec compiles with sanitizers

runner.sh is a script that runs awk files on a usr_bin_data.txt files that I used while learning awk. Although you can achieve the same with awk command it is useful if you want to quickly run multiple files
