# useful_scripts
A list of useful scripts I have used to automate my workflow


screen.sh is a script that moves your display and changes your resolution, This is useful if your laptop screen has a certain area not working or artefacted. and usually these artefacts occour vertically. Just change the new_x and new_y and the formula to move your screen logically
